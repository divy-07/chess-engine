## Description

[//]: # "Edit this section when implementation is complete"

Note: Although the engine is currently under construction, a big chunk of the work is done.

The motive behind this project was to create a chess engine that can beat us the creators, rated around 1200.
We expect the engine to be able to beat us in the very near future, once the engine is completely implemented.
Apart from our passion for chess, we also wanted to apply the knowledge we have gained in our Software Engineering courses to a real world problem.
This includes the use of object-oriented programming, unit testing, concurrency, and other software engineering practices.

The choice of language was Java, as not only is it a nice mix between C++(speed) and Python(readability).
But also because it is a language that we are both familiar with.

## Using the Engine

Using the engine currently requires Java 14 and gradle 7.5 or higher. 
Steps:
- Clone/download the repository
- Open a terminal in the root directory of the project
- Run `./gradlew clean build` to create the jar file
- Use any UCI-supporting GUI to play against the engine. We recommend [Arena](http://www.playwitharena.de/)
- Register the engine with GUI using the .jar file in the build/libs directory
- Play against the engine!
